### Scaling: Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
## What is scaling?
In system Design terms, scaling is the process of increasing the system's performance and resources to handle more traffic or load without making it more complex.
##### There are two types of scaling:
- Vertical Scaling (Scaling-up)
- Horizontal Scaling (Scaling-out)
### Vertical Scaling:
Vertical scaling is also known as scale-up, the process of increasing the system capacity or capabilities of an existing hardware or software component within a system. You can add more power to your system by adding a better processor, increasing RAM or making other changes. Vertical scaling aims to improve the performance and capacity of the system without changing the fundamental architecture or adding additional servers.

##### Pros of Vertical Scaling:
- Ease Management
- Consistency
- Increase Capacity

##### Cons of Vertical scaling:
- Limited scalability
- Single point of failure
- Increase cost
### Horizontal Scaling:
Horizontal scaling also known as scale-out, process of increasing the capacity or performance of a system by adding more machines or servers to distribute the workload across all nodes or units. 

In horizontal scaling no need to change or replace the server we simply add more and more servers or machines to handle more requests.


##### Pros of Horizontal Scaling:
- Increase capacity
- Improve performance
- Increase fault tolerance
##### Cons of Horizontal Scaling:
 - Complexity
 - Data inconsistency 
 - Increase cost
